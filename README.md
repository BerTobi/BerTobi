Hey, I'm Tobi ðŸ‘‹

CS student at UBA. I like making games and understanding how computers actually work.
Right now I'm working on Caelis Chaos (a game in C++ and SDL) and doing some AI safety stuff in Python. Also getting into low-level programming with C and assembly - gonna start building an OS soon because why not.
What I use: C++, C, Assembly, Python, SDL
What I'm into: game engines, operating systems, AI safety

"From assembly to AI, building the future one line of code at a time"
